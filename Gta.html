<br>
<p> Grand Theft Auto 5 Online is a mulit-player game where players from all over can connect <br>
via console or pc. In Gta you have the option to roam in freemode , play LTS(Last Team Standing),<br>
Deathmatches, Heist, or regular jobs. A benefit from all of these would be the outcome of being paid, virtually ofcourse<br>
 </p>
<br>
<h3>Rating</h3>
<p> 7 out of 10<br>
I give this game a 7 out of 10 for the great graphics and simplicity of enojoyment.<br>
Although the game is fun to play , it has its moments of annoyance. Such as God Mode glitches, and <br>
the difficulty of getting money.
<br>
<h3>Price</h3>
<br>
<p> $16.00-$40.00 (The game it self)<br>
<br>
  Playstation plus $25.00 - 3 months
<br>
  Xbox live $25.00 - 3 months
