<br>
<p> Rainbow Six Siege is a stratigical, tactial shooting game on mulitple platforms.Including<br>
Playstation 4 , Xbox1 , and Pc(Personal Computer).Within in the game you can play different modes<br>
which are Secure the Area, Bomb, and Custom game mode.This game is not a typical story mode where a person would <br>
follow the options and guidelines of the game but rather it is online to where you play with others and do as you want.</p>
<br>
<h3>Rating</h3>
<p> 6 out of 10<br>
I give this game a 6 out of 10 for the great graphics and simplicity of enojoyment.The<br>
main downfall would be the constant glitches being found by players.Once<br>
these glitches are exposed and exploited it causes the game to become toxic and annoying.<br>
Beside the glitches I do higly recommend this game.
<br>
<h3>Price</h3>
<br>
<p> $18.00-$30.00 ( Depending on where you purchase from)
