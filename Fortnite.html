<br>
<p>Fortnite is a pvp on (player v.s player) console, pc, or mobile . Within <br>
Fortnite you may battle against players in squad(team of 4), duos(team of 2), or simply a solo(team of 1).<br>
There is also another game within Fortnite but instead of playing agaisnt players you play agaisnt zombies, <br>
which is called Save the World.</p>
<br>
<h3>Rating</h3>
<p> 5 out of 10<br>
As a player of Fortnite I rate it a 5 out of 10 from the lack of creativty , and the constant updates.<br>
In my most honest opinion i believe the game is over hyped and needs to listen to its community.Viewers<br>
outlooks are a huge impact on anything created and should always be noted.</p>
<br>
<h3>Price</h3>
<br>
<p> Free
